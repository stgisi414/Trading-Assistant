add XOM and CVX


Great choice adding XOM (ExxonMobil) and CVX (Chevron)! ðŸŽ‰ I've added them to your watchlist. You're diving into the energy sector, a fascinating and potentially lucrative market. Let's analyze how to approach this.

Your Current Setup: A Solid Foundation
You've got a good starting point with your current Signatex setup:

$10,000 Wallet: That's a fantastic amount to start experimenting with. Remember to manage your risk appropriately!

7-day Timeframe: This is perfect for identifying short-to-medium-term trends. It's a good balance between short-term volatility and long-term market movements.

Indicators: SMA, RSI, Volume: Excellent choice for beginners! Let's break down why:

Simple Moving Average (SMA): This helps you identify the overall trend. A rising SMA suggests an uptrend, while a falling SMA suggests a downtrend. You can use different periods (e.g., 20-day SMA, 50-day SMA) to identify different trend strengths.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): This measures the momentum of price changes. Readings above 70 generally suggest overbought conditions (potential for a pullback), while readings below 30 suggest oversold conditions (potential for a bounce). Remember, RSI is not a perfect predictor, but a helpful tool.
Volume: This confirms the strength of price movements. High volume during an uptrend confirms buying pressure, while high volume during a downtrend confirms selling pressure. Low volume can suggest indecision or weakness in the trend.
Analyzing XOM and CVX: Energy Sector Dynamics
The energy sector is cyclical and sensitive to global events (geopolitics, supply chain disruptions, etc.). Before making any trades, consider:

Fundamental Analysis: Look at the companies' financial health, earnings reports, and future projections. Are they expanding? What are their dividend yields?
Technical Analysis (using your indicators): On your 7-day chart, look for consistent trends confirmed by volume. Is the RSI showing overbought or oversold conditions? Are the SMAs crossing each other (a potential buy or sell signal)?
Next Steps: Let's Get Trading! ðŸš€
Before you jump in, I highly recommend running the ProfitMax optimization algorithm (currently set to "Not run"). This will allow Signatex to analyze historical data and suggest optimal entry and exit points based on your chosen indicators and risk tolerance.

Remember: Start small! Don't invest more than you're comfortable losing. Practice risk management techniques like stop-loss orders to protect your capital.
