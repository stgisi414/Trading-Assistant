            description: `A classic bearish reversal pattern identified in ${symbol}. The pattern consists of three peaks with the middle peak (head) being the highest, flanked by two lower peaks (shoulders) of approximately equal height. This formation suggests that the uptrend is losing momentum and a reversal to the downside is likely.`,
            tradingImplications: `This is a strong bearish signal. Consider taking profits on long positions or initiating short positions once the neckline is broken. The pattern suggests potential downside momentum with a target price calculated by measuring the distance from the head to the neckline and projecting it downward from the neckline break.`,

            description: `An inverted head and shoulders pattern (also called head and shoulders bottom) has been identified in ${symbol}. This bullish reversal pattern features three troughs with the middle trough (head) being the lowest, flanked by two higher troughs (shoulders). This formation indicates that the downtrend is weakening and an upward reversal is anticipated.`,
            tradingImplications: `This is a strong bullish signal indicating potential trend reversal. Consider closing short positions or initiating long positions once the neckline resistance is broken with strong volume. The pattern targets are typically measured by taking the distance from the head to the neckline and projecting it upward from the breakout point.`,

            description: `A double top pattern has formed in ${symbol}, characterized by two peaks at approximately the same price level separated by a moderate decline. This bearish reversal pattern suggests that the asset has twice failed to break above a significant resistance level, indicating potential weakness and upcoming downward pressure.`,
            tradingImplications: `This pattern signals potential bearish reversal. The double top is confirmed when price breaks below the support level (valley between the two peaks). Traders should consider profit-taking on long positions or preparing for short positions. The price target is typically the distance from the peaks to the valley, projected downward from the support break.`,

            description: `A double bottom pattern has been identified in ${symbol}, featuring two troughs at approximately the same price level with a peak in between. This bullish reversal pattern indicates that the asset has found strong support at this level twice, suggesting potential upward momentum as selling pressure diminishes.`,
            tradingImplications: `This is a bullish reversal signal. The pattern is confirmed when price breaks above the resistance level (peak between the two bottoms) with increased volume. Consider closing short positions or initiating long positions on the breakout. Price targets are calculated by measuring the distance from the bottoms to the peak and projecting upward from the breakout level.`,
